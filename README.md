# FileFormatChanger
A python script that changes file format (extension) of all the files inside a given folder.

Usage:
Feed the required file format by editing the 'new_extension' variable on line 7

Note:
This script does NOT convert a file from one format to other. It is instead an automation script to change the extension of all files inside 
a folder for god-knows-what purposes.
